## Scope

First release of mechanical drawings of the Compact PCB Maker. 
This is a partial release that comprises all the frame related mechanical drawings. Other parts and corrections will follow in other releases.

## Suggestions

We suggest you to print the parts as they are, because the printing position is designed to enhance the mechanical behavior.

We also suggest you to print with a 0.2 mm layer thickness, 25% of infill, 1.5 mm of wall thickness and extrusion width (also called line width) of 0.5 mm.
